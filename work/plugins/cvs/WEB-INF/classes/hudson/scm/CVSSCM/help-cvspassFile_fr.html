    CVS stores the login and password information in a file called ".cvspass". Normally
    CVS loads this file in your home directory, but if you want to have Hudson load it
    from a different place, specify the full path to the file. Otherwise leave it blank.

      If you are using CVSNT <a href="scm/CVSSCM/version">(am I?)</a>, then this setting is
      likely to be ignored. See <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTasks/cvspass.html">
      this note</a> for more about why. In this case, you need to run "cvs login" command
      manually to enter password. If Hudson runs under the same user as you do, then
      this would be straight-forward. However, if Hudson runs as a service, you'd need to
      first launch <tt>CMD.exe</tt> as the SYSTEM user, then you need to run cvs command
      from there. See <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/adioltean/articles/271063.aspx">this document</a>
      for how to do this.
