  Hudson 1.20 and earlier used to create redundant directories inside the workspace.
  For example, if the CVS module name is "foo/bar", it first created "foo/bar" and
  then put everything below. With this option checked off, there will be no more
  such unnecessary intermediate directories.

  <p>
  If you have multiple modules to check out, this option is forced (otherwise they'll overlap.) 

  <p>
  This affects other path specifiers, such as artifact archivers --- you now specify
  "build/foo.jar" instead of "foo/build/foo.jar".
