      Specify a whitespace-separated list of maven goals or phases to be executed,
      such as "install javadoc:javadoc". If left unspecified,
      <a href="http://maven.apache.org/pom.html#basebuild_element">the default goal</a>
      specified in the POM will be used, and if even that is unspecified, "install"
      will be run.

      <p>
        This field can also include any other Maven options. Jenkins also makes
        <a href="${rootURL}/env-vars.html">these variables</a>
        available as system properties to builds.
