  For some repository URL (such as <tt>scpexe</tt>), Maven may require
  additional configuration (such as user name, executable path, etc.)

  Maven wants you to specify this in <tt>~/.m2/settings.xml</tt> of
  the user that runs Hudson, and this ID value is used to retrieve
  the setting information from this file (that is, the &lt;server>
  element with this ID value will be consulted for various
  protocol-specific configuration values.)

  <p>
  See
  <a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-deploy-plugin/usage.html">the maven-deploy-plugin usage
  page</a> for more details.
