 click <a href="{0}/scm/SubversionSCM/enterCredential" target="_blank">this link</a> \
 and specify different credential.

  through the environment variable <tt>SVN_REVISION</tt>, provided that you are only checking out \
  one module. If you have multiple modules checked out, use the \
  <a href="http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/svnversion/" target="_blank">svnversion command</a>.
