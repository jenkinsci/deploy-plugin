    Often creating a new tag on the repository requires a credential.
    By default, Hudson uses the same credential it uses for checking out and updating workspaces during builds,
    but in some Subversion server set up, that credential may not have enough permissions to create a tag
    (a typical example of this is a Subversion repository that allows anonymous read-only access.)

    <p>
    In such a case, use this option to specify alternative credential that has necessary permissions.
    This credential is used for just one time. This option is also useful if leaving the correct record
    of who created a tag is important for you.
